<h1>Haste Dashboard</h1>

> <p>It's made from the source of <a href="https://demo.themesberg.com/volt/">Volt Dashboard</a> free version. But I did adjustments and enhancements according to my need. If you find the changes good enough then you can also use it and it's completely free. I will try to add more premium features available on pro versions of different bootstrap 5 dashboards over time or you can also contribute into the template. Thank you for checking it out.</p>

> <p>Because it made from the source of volt dashboard you can refer their docs <a href="https://themesberg.com/docs/volt-bootstrap-5-dashboard/getting-started/quick-start/">from here</a> for utilities and helpers because the changes are not drastic by any means. But the biggest change I think is the build tool and the project structure. I used <a href="https://vitejs.dev/">Vite</a> for the building process.</p>
